Question 2.1.
This code is a sample implementation of a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It defines a Book model using Mongoose, connects to a MongoDB database, and provides routes for performing CRUD operations on the Book model. The routes include GET requests for retrieving all books or a specific book by ID, a POST request for creating a new book, a PUT request for updating an existing book by ID, and a DELETE request for deleting an existing book by ID. With this way, each functionnality and of the API is well-isolated and can be easily accessible for debugging or upgrading. I decided to make a change while using MongoDB and remove the id attribute because we know that MongoDB already create for us an id key for the model which is more efficient than create our own. 

The process of using MongoDB with Node.js and Mongoose is relatively straightforward and efficient for building applications that require database functionality. However, in a production environment, it is important to consider scaling and performance issues. One alternative option to consider is using a cloud-based database service such as MongoDB Atlas or Amazon RDS to handle these concerns. Additionally, implementing caching mechanisms and load balancing strategies can also improve the overall performance of the application.


Question 2.2.
1. The response status code 400 is used to indicate a bad request, but in this case, it might be more appropriate to use a different status code, such as 403 (Forbidden), as the user is not allowed to perform the action due to their age.

2. The response messages "Too young" and "User added" are hardcoded strings. It would be better to use constants or variables for these messages, as they may need to be reused or translated in the future.

3. It is unclear what "db" refers to in the code. If it is a database connection or an external dependency, it would be helpful to handle any errors that may occur during the addUser operation and provide appropriate error messages or responses.

4. It would be beneficial to include error handling for any unexpected errors that may occur during the request processing, such as catching exceptions and returning appropriate error responses.

5. Depending on the requirements, it might be necessary to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access this endpoint.
